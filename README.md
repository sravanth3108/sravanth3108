During my tenure at **Northwest Missouri State University** as a **Graduate Teaching Assistant** in Database Management Systems, I had the opportunity to guide more than 100 students in their course projects. This experience honed my skills in **MySQL, MongoDB, and PHP**, and I conducted algorithm-based review sessions for graduate students, achieving a remarkable **95% student satisfaction rate**.

Additionally, my work as a **Software Engineer** at **Tech Mahindra** involved developing robust web applications using **ASP.NET, C#, .NET MVC,** and **LINQ**. I collaborated with cross-functional teams, ensuring our applications were both innovative and user-friendly. One of my significant achievements was being recognized as the 'Employee of the Quarter' for my exceptional contributions to software development and leadership.

Furthermore, I contributed to innovative projects, including the development of a **Professional-Based Learning website** using **Spring Boot MVC, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript,** and **MongoDB**. This platform encouraged idea sharing among university members and external users, fostering a collaborative learning environment.

In summary, my experiences have equipped me with strong expertise in **database management**, **web development**, and various technologies such as **MySQL, MongoDB, ASP.NET, C#, and .NET MVC**. I am enthusiastic about applying these skills to contribute to cutting-edge projects and solve complex problems in the field of computer science.
